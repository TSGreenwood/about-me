    <h1>Welcome to your journey learning about me as I learn about programming.</h1>

  
    <p>As a student, I want to build a foundation in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Git Bash, version control, and other supporting skills. This will take me a very long time at first. I can’t get into a flow state for hours at a time if I’m bored, so I’ll have weird and silly subjects within a functional framework, knowing I can apply those abilities to more professional content in the future. </p>
